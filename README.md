# geojson2svg

Work in progress. This is a hard fork of [whosonfirst/go-geojson-svg](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-geojson-svg), which is itself a hard fork of [fapian/geojson2svg](https://github.com/fapian/geojson2svg) (with some extent functionaltiy added).

Both libraries rely on [paulmach/go.geojson](https://github.com/paulmach/go.geojson) for GeoJSON decoding. At some point I may update this to rely on either [paulmach/orb](https://github.com/paulmach/orb) or preferably [twpayne/go-geom/](https://github.com/twpayne/go-geom/).
